AA Meetup is a progressive web application I wrote to help people find AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) meetings in their area.

The front end uses the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/) built on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

The back end uses [Koa](https://koajs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
